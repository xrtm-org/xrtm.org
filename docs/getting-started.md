# Getting Started with XRTM

This is the shortest honest path to first success with XRTM.

You will run the released health-check plus guided first command, inspect the
generated artifacts, and browse the results. The default path uses the built-in
mock provider, so you do **not** need API keys or a local model server.

> Release-gated command note: the command blocks in this guide are validated
> against `xrtm/docs/release-command-contract.json` so the public site cannot
> drift ahead of the latest published `xrtm` package surface.

## 1. Install

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install xrtm==0.3.2
```

**Supported Python versions:** `>=3.11,<3.13`

## 2. Run the guided first command

```bash
xrtm start
```

`xrtm start` is the released health check plus guided first run. It verifies
imports, runs the deterministic mock-provider workflow, confirms the key
artifacts, and prints exact next commands with the run id and report path.

## 3. Inspect the run artifacts

The run directory contains the same evidence used by higher-level views:

```bash
xrtm runs show latest --runs-dir runs
xrtm artifacts inspect --latest --runs-dir runs
xrtm report html --latest --runs-dir runs
```

```text
runs/<run-id>/
  run.json
  questions.jsonl
  forecasts.jsonl
  eval.json
  train.json
  provider.json
  events.jsonl
  run_summary.json
  report.html
  logs/
```

`monitor.json` is optional monitor state. Real monitor runs populate it with
watches and thresholds, while some profile-driven runs may carry an idle
placeholder. Use `xrtm monitor list` status and watch counts to distinguish
active monitors from ordinary runs.

## 4. Browse the results

Launch the local WebUI:

```bash
xrtm web --runs-dir runs
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765` in your browser.

If you prefer the terminal, launch the TUI instead:

```bash
xrtm tui --runs-dir runs
```

## 5. What you just proved

You completed the first published XRTM event-forecasting loop:

1. **Health check**: verified the installed stack and local readiness
2. **Forecast run**: ran a provider-free forecasting workflow without external providers
3. **Scored evidence**: verified the newest run and its outputs on disk
4. **Review surface**: opened the same run through WebUI or TUI

That is the core product path for newcomers today.

It is also intentionally modest: the default mock-provider run proves that
XRTM can create scored, inspectable evidence and teach you how to review it.
It does **not** by itself prove visible forecast-quality improvement over time,
because the released mock provider is deterministic and should remain stable.

## Official proof-point workflows

After the first run, these release-gated workflows expand the same
event-forecasting loop:

### 1. Provider-free first success

```bash
xrtm start
xrtm runs show latest --runs-dir runs
xrtm artifacts inspect --latest --runs-dir runs
xrtm report html --latest --runs-dir runs
xrtm web --runs-dir runs
```

### 2. Benchmark and performance workflow

```bash
xrtm perf run --scenario provider-free-smoke --iterations 3 --limit 1 --runs-dir runs-perf --output performance.json
xrtm web --runs-dir runs --smoke
```

Use this workflow when you want deterministic benchmark evidence and a quick
WebUI route smoke without introducing provider noise.

Treat it as the released evaluation baseline:

- `performance.json` captures repeatable runtime evidence
- the paired `runs-perf/<run-id>/run_summary.json` carries scored run metrics such as Brier and ECE
- on the provider-free path, repeated runs should stay stable enough to act as a control before you change provider/model settings
- if the compare output is effectively unchanged across repeated mock runs, that is the expected control behavior

### 3. Monitoring, history, and export workflow

```bash
xrtm profile starter my-local --runs-dir runs
xrtm run profile my-local
xrtm monitor start --provider mock --limit 2 --runs-dir runs
xrtm runs compare <run-id-a> <run-id-b> --runs-dir runs
xrtm runs export latest --runs-dir runs --output export.json
xrtm runs export latest --runs-dir runs --output export.csv --format csv
```

When you compare two runs, read the output like an evaluation gate:

- **Brier / ECE:** lower is better
- **warnings / errors:** should stay at zero
- **duration / tokens:** efficiency cost of a change
- use compare only after the two runs are meant to answer the same question set
- unchanged mock-vs-mock compares mean the baseline is stable; introduce a real provider/model/runtime change before claiming improvement
- improved scores with similar operational health are promotion candidates; regressions or large runtime jumps should be investigated or rejected

### 4. Local-LLM advanced workflow

```bash
export XRTM_LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1
xrtm local-llm status
xrtm demo --provider local-llm --limit 1 --max-tokens 768 --runs-dir runs-local
```

Only switch to local-LLM mode after the provider-free path above is working.

Commands that are still on the next coordinated release train—corpus-validation
flows and user-attribution flags—stay off this guide until the release
contract moves forward.

## Good next steps

### Run a slightly larger local pass

```bash
xrtm demo --provider mock --limit 10 --runs-dir runs
```

### Create a reusable local profile

```bash
xrtm profile starter my-local --runs-dir runs
xrtm profile show my-local
xrtm run profile my-local
```

This writes `.xrtm/profiles/my-local.json` and keeps the workflow on the same
mock-provider path you just proved.

### Pick the guide that matches your role

- **Researcher / model-eval**: stay on the provider-free path, then use the [researcher workflow](./workflows/researcher-model-eval) for the honest control → candidate → compare decision loop and the clearly labeled advanced paths.
- **Operator**: continue with the [operator runbook](./workflows/operator-runbook) for monitoring, profiles, performance checks, exports, and troubleshooting.
- **Team**: read [team workflows](./workflows/team-workflows) for realistic multi-user patterns and current limitations.
- **Developer / integrator**: use the [developer workflow](./workflows/developer-integrator) and the [packages overview](./framework/intro) to move from product usage into APIs and examples.

## Advanced and optional: local LLM mode

Only switch to `--provider local-llm` after the provider-free path above is
working.

Use local-LLM mode when you specifically need to evaluate a real local model
and you already have a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint available.

Typical prerequisites:
- a running local inference server such as llama.cpp, Ollama, or LocalAI
- downloaded model weights
- enough CPU/GPU resources for the model you chose
- willingness to trade the quick start for a slower, more complex setup

Minimal verification flow:

```bash
export XRTM_LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1
xrtm local-llm status
xrtm demo --provider local-llm --limit 1 --max-tokens 768 --runs-dir runs-local
```

For deeper setup and troubleshooting, use the [operator runbook](./workflows/operator-runbook).

## Quick troubleshooting

### `xrtm: command not found`

Activate the virtual environment first:

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
```

### Installation fails on Python 3.13

This is expected. XRTM currently supports Python `>=3.11,<3.13`.

### `xrtm start` reports warnings

Check the warning text first. Optional components may be missing even when the
default provider-free path is fine.

### Local-LLM health check fails

Go back to the provider-free path, confirm the main install works, then use the
[operator runbook](./workflows/operator-runbook) to debug your local endpoint.
