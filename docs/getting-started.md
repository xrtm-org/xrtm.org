# Getting Started with XRTM

XRTM is AI for event forecasting. This is the shortest honest path to first
success.

You will run the guided first command, inspect the generated artifacts, and
browse the results. The default path uses the built-in mock provider, so you do
**not** need API keys or a local model server.

## 1. Install

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install xrtm==0.3.0
```

**Supported Python versions:** `>=3.11,<3.13`

## 2. Run the guided first command

```bash
xrtm start
```

`xrtm start` verifies readiness, runs the deterministic mock-provider demo, confirms the key artifacts, and prints exact next commands.

On success, the final quickstart output explicitly shows:

- what just succeeded
- the run id
- the artifact location
- the report location
- exact latest-run follow-up commands

Treat that final panel as proof that XRTM completed a full local run and wrote the canonical evidence to disk.

This provider-free first run:

- loads bundled questions locally
- generates deterministic forecasts without API calls
- evaluates the run with built-in scoring
- writes a complete run directory under `runs/`

## 3. Inspect the run artifacts

```bash
xrtm runs show latest --runs-dir runs
xrtm artifacts inspect --latest --runs-dir runs
xrtm report html --latest --runs-dir runs
```

`xrtm artifacts inspect` prints the canonical artifact inventory with on-disk locations, so you can verify exactly what the first run wrote.

The run directory contains the same evidence used by higher-level views:

```text
runs/<run-id>/
  run.json
  questions.jsonl
  forecasts.jsonl
  eval.json
  train.json
  provider.json
  events.jsonl
  run_summary.json
  monitor.json
  report.html
  logs/
```

## 4. Browse the results

Launch the local WebUI:

```bash
xrtm web --runs-dir runs
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765` in your browser.

If you prefer the terminal, launch the TUI instead:

```bash
xrtm tui --runs-dir runs
```

## 5. What you just proved

You completed the first XRTM event-forecasting loop:

1. **Forecast run**: ran a forecasting workflow without external providers
2. **Scored evidence**: verified the run and its outputs on disk
3. **Review surface**: opened the same run through WebUI or TUI

That is the core product path for newcomers.

## Official proof-point workflows

After the first run, these four workflows expand the same event-forecasting
loop:

### 1. Provider-free first success

```bash
xrtm start
xrtm runs show latest --runs-dir runs
xrtm artifacts inspect --latest --runs-dir runs
xrtm report html --latest --runs-dir runs
xrtm web --runs-dir runs
```

### 2. Benchmark and validation workflow

```bash
xrtm perf run --scenario provider-free-smoke --iterations 3 --limit 1 --runs-dir runs-perf --output performance.json
xrtm validate run --provider mock --limit 10 --iterations 2 --runs-dir runs-validation
```

### 3. Monitoring, history, and report workflow

```bash
xrtm profile starter my-local --runs-dir runs
xrtm run profile my-local
xrtm monitor start --provider mock --limit 2 --runs-dir runs
xrtm runs compare <run-id-a> <run-id-b> --runs-dir runs
xrtm runs export latest --runs-dir runs --output latest-run.json
```

### 4. Local-LLM advanced workflow

```bash
export XRTM_LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1
xrtm local-llm status
xrtm demo --provider local-llm --limit 1 --max-tokens 768 --runs-dir runs-local
```

Only switch to local-LLM mode after the provider-free path above is working.

## Good next steps

### Run a slightly larger local pass

```bash
xrtm demo --provider mock --limit 10
```

### Scaffold a reusable local profile

```bash
xrtm profile starter my-local --runs-dir runs
xrtm run profile my-local
```

This starter scaffold creates `.xrtm/profiles/my-local.json`, ensures the local `runs/` workspace exists, and keeps the workflow on the same mock-provider path you just proved with `xrtm start`.

### Pick the guide that matches your role

- **Researcher / model-eval**: use the [researcher workflow](./workflows/researcher-model-eval) for the benchmark/validation workflow, comparisons, metrics, and exports.
- **Operator**: continue with the [operator runbook](./workflows/operator-runbook) for the monitoring/history/report workflow, profiles, performance checks, and troubleshooting.
- **Team**: read [team workflows](./workflows/team-workflows) for realistic multi-user patterns and current limitations.
- **Developer / integrator**: use the [developer workflow](./workflows/developer-integrator) and the [packages overview](./framework/intro) to move from product usage into APIs and examples.

## Advanced and optional: local LLM mode

Only switch to `--provider local-llm` after the provider-free path above is working.

Use local-LLM mode when you specifically need to evaluate a real local model and you already have a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint available.

Typical prerequisites:

- a running local inference server such as llama.cpp, Ollama, or LocalAI
- downloaded model weights
- enough CPU/GPU resources for the model you chose
- willingness to trade the 5-minute quick start for a slower, more complex setup

Minimal verification flow:

```bash
export XRTM_LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1
xrtm local-llm status
xrtm demo --provider local-llm --limit 1 --max-tokens 768
```

For deeper setup and troubleshooting, use the [operator runbook](./workflows/operator-runbook).

## Quick troubleshooting

### `xrtm: command not found`

Activate the virtual environment first:

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
```

### Installation fails on Python 3.13

This is expected. XRTM currently supports Python `>=3.11,<3.13`.

### `xrtm doctor` shows warnings

Check the warning text first. Optional components may be missing even when the default provider-free first-run path is fine.

### Local-LLM health check fails

Go back to the provider-free path, confirm the main install works, then use the [operator runbook](./workflows/operator-runbook) to debug your local endpoint.
